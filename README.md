# passwordGenerator

## Description

This project is a password generator. The goal behind this project is to generate a password based off of criteria chosen by the user. The interaction between the user and the application is through the built in browser API's(alert(),confirm(), and prompt().

## Featured functions

- To reduce/ eliminate user error I confined the criteria prompts to a boolean request using confirm().

- By implementing a confirm() based user interaction I have also made the application more user friendly and eliminated the chance of users becoming frustrated by needing to type a specific response to a prompt() function.

## Usage 

The application was published through github and can be accessed via the provided link below.
